that 's your problem you never let anyone in plankton the rock plankton the loner
you have to do everything yourself

okay okay i 'm do no more
sheldon ha ha

duh
uhh there he go again cut it out plankton
i 've heard this joke before
maybe you 'd get a real present from santa if you be n't the big jerk in bikini bottom

well you 'll never get the formula with that attitude maybe a thousand and four will be your lucky number
oh right the launching i 've get them all on my hard drive

plankton your dinner be ready plankton plankton do you hear me
plankton where have you be
did you get the krabby patty formula like i have to ask
you need a more positive outlook
plankton
i think you hit it you could n't see the correct combination because you have only one eye you lack depth perception
what you need be a second eye
your experiment be miss essential one ingredient
no it 's cell from another eye even a single teardrop would contain enough dna
no silly they have to be from somebody who already have two eye
are you sure you want to go through with this
so do it work
oh you 're a happy camper did you finally steal the formula
it 's that new eye of yours your evil dna have become corrupt by spongebob 's nice dna you 've go from evil to neevil you 're become a harmless a that fry cook
oh really let 's test it shall we tell me what you see in these ink blot
nope try again what do this remind you of
try this
i 'll give you a hint

ah ah spongecopy
well if you must know
oh i 'm sure it 'll be a huge success

oh oh eugene i thought you 'd never ask
oh eugene
good day future motorist i 'm mr puff state accredit boat instructor today we 'll be discuss the difference between a driver with boat smart
and a driver without boat smart
let 's see some example shall we tire pressure before you can even think about boat the boater who us boat smart always fill his tire to the appropriate level while this driver pay no need to boat smart buckle up a demonstrate by this driver he have enough boat smart to use his seat belt and avoid a serious casualty a a result of a collision notice how he come gently to a stop sign now this driver with no regard for safety well at least he have his seat belt on adjust your mirror what 's our boat smart boater up to now you guess it he 's adjust his mirror before he begin boat unlike this degenerate boater
finally and most importantly a driver with boat smart always pay attention to his surroundings and avoids distraction notice how this driver 's eye be lock firmly on the road and here we have the epitome of a driver who be carelessly distract himself from the road and safety
spongebob i mean a boater without boat smart show contempt for his boater brother and the law
never mind
have you ever taught him to drive
a drive theme be what spongebob would love

oh yes what i need be you

the rest of me be up here
i find all this laughter to be highly illogical
look at them these graceful stoic creature of the deep
nonsense my vocabulary be infinitely expand
yes i capture one a well without disturb it delicate ecosystem it be wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner
let u go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature
yes quite
indeed
oh you want to run some statistic or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of say phenomenon
doe n't feel like fun
you ca n't strum a jellyfish
oh my look at the time i really must be go
just study this amaze subspecies
well since i be finish with my work i 'll humor you with your trivial pursuit i 'd recognize that piece anywhere cornelius pufferfish 's opus 67 symphony in blue
it 's a beautiful piece execution need some work may i suggest on the 7th bar of the adagio andante that you add a little fortissimo on the arpeggiated b-flat scale
well that be because you rarely think
a creative outlet provide a spiritual release and help facilitate a healthy mental balance ah
squarepants i find your humor vulgar
let 's take it from the top not so excellent squidward let me demonstrate the proper technique on second thought practice make perfect let 's begin thank you my good chap unfortunately this be a solo piece for clarinet only and 1 2 3 4 stop enough find yourself a new mentor
no spongebob i 'm afraid not

robert my dear it 's no use we 've just grown apart

i know it 's hard but brace up chap
maybe our path will cross again someday think fondly of me squarepants
why thank you sandra i find your intellect rather stimulate a well
you simply change the literal term to a coefficient and the minuend will achieve the desire quotient even the simplest of mammal can figure it out with a little thought
i 'm merely suggest you lack the ability to solve remedial equation
i 'd use a more sophisticated word like 'impaired
i be only try to help
surround by knowledge and no one to share it with no one i can call friend who 's that old chap i use to run with spongebob
aww the glory day why have we grown apart i must apply all that i know to solve this problem what could it be what 's different ah what i 'd do anything to have my old buddy back by my side again

i 'm go to duplicate my action from that day to ascertain the origin of my cha an nge
quite unchanged actually
you say you found my dislodge cranial cap last time

i 'm just wonder spongebob i mean he do defy all scientific logic consider the fact that all air breathing mammal need oxygen to the brain and lung to survive for more than 3 minute
what have gotten into you spongebob ca n't i talk about what must surely be happen from a biological standpoint i mean like the lack of oxygen will heighten the capillary in the lung cause a dangerous level of carbon monoxide to rise in the bloodstream which in turn lead to a ghostly blue color to the skin follow by eventual unconsciousness
i knew kenny be a fake
just get out of here already you can never trust a cat or be it a dog
he have such a way with word

right away sir
krabs trust me and i let him down
hi patrick maybe you can help me
with this
not that kind of help this use to have the krabby patty secret ingredient inside but now it 's miss
someone stole it patrick and we need to find out who
you and i be gon na have to do a little detective work
aha i knew it be you
oh come on plankton do n't play dumb you know you stole the secret krabby patty ingredient
why do n't you tell me is it
all right no more joke either you tell me where the secret ingredient be or we 'll be force to use other mean of make you talk
then how do you explain this
and so the truth floweth forth
mm-hmm
yuck
well he 's clean but if plankton do n't steal the ingredient who do
only someone who specializes in science could reverse engineer the recipe base on the secret ingredient hmm a scientist there she be you hang back i 'm go in for a closer look oh my gosh it be sandy enjoy them krabby patty lady
oh long enough buddy
i 'm onto you squirrel you thought no one could figure it out but i piece it together i know exactly how you get all those patty
what i be get at be that you cloaked yourself an invisibility potion snuck through the security perimeter
then use a time-freezing device to freeze time use a laser beam to cut open the case stole the krabby patty secret ingredient reverse engineer it and make your own patty so you would n't have to pay
283 krabby patty that 's right i cooked this order i guess this mean you do n't use a laser beam or invisibility
my own house huh why 'd you do it gary
you 've told u that story 100 time now gary unfortunately my partner and i do n't want to hear story we want to hear the truth look we know you stole the secret ingredient and it 's obvious how you do it first you hitch a ride on a security chopper then jumped into the drop zone then when i stop to pull up my sock you snuck up behind me and do what any snail could do you shot corrosive acid from your tear duct which melt the case allow you to steal the secret ingredient
yeah you 're right gary that be impossible i never would have stop to pull up my sock during a pickup
what 's that gary
you do see someone leave the krusty krab with a mysterious black case that night snail could you please describe this this marauder to the sketch artist
open up in there tentacle we know you 're in there we just want to ask you a few he 's not cooperate
gotcha you thought you could hide your crime
well i 'm glad you ask because this be about you steal the krabby patty secret ingredient and we have an eyewitness who saw you leave the scene of the crime with a mysterious black case
yes because you ca n't make krabby patty without tap dance shoe
i guess this mean you do n't steal the secret ingredient
krabs i do n't know how sir but somebody stole the krabby patty secret ingredient
i know krabs it just slip away from me somehow
all i know be that it have to be someone who knew about the delivery and be at the krusty krab during the delivery and this person would have to know what to do with the secret ingredient when he get it
me
krabs be n't that the steal secret ingredient
step right up and get your free krabby patty
